      msg ("Welcome to Ravenous Raccoon. Rocco is a Raccoon desperate for some ice cream, and he needs it before he dies from withdra- I mean lack of happiness! Heh... Anyway<br/><br/>Rocco has 30 days to get that ice cream. Each day consists of 30 turns and you have thirty days. That's 900 turns total. A turn is any action, whether you type it in or click on a hyperlink, so act carefully!<br/><br/>Additionally, we have the health bar: AKA Rocco is a very hungry critter. Every turn Rocco's hunger will drop by 1. It can be replenished by items found across the junkyard, or by sleeping at the raccoon base. Sleeping will fully recover health, but it will also end the day, so choose when you sleep carefully.<br/><br/>If hunger reaches zero, Rocco is carefully transported back to the Raccoon Base, hunger is restored to 20%, and a new day begins.<br/><br/>Rocco's goals lie at the far reaches of the junkyard. You can help him by just exploring or getting a helping hand from Casey. Go talk  to him now for the first questline. This game is meant to be comical and silly; don't take things too seriously and have fun!")
